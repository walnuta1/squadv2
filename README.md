## Introduction
[SQuAD v2](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is an ongoing NLP research challenge. 
[Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) based model is a state-of-art 
mechanism for NLP tasks. We intend to tackle the SQuAD v2 problem with an architecture that 
is based on transformer.
